CAUTION: Don't stick forks in electric sockets.

TIP: After someone sticks a fork in a socket, you'll need to reset the circuit in the breaker box in the dark and scary basement.

WARNING: Never go into the basement.

IMPORTANT: A monster lives in the basement.

NOTE: If you go into the basement, see if you can find Kenny's parka.
